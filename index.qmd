Hey, thanks for visiting this page, Iâ€™m **Shivam Pandey** a tech exploring the directions to make AI explainable and generalize over every task with minimal data sample.

## Research Orientation: *[WIP]*
Large blob of Compute with a-lot of data will always win but it still remains data-inefficient and lacks generalization thus can't be accounted for intelligence.
