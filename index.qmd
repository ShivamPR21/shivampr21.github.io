Welcome to my site! I'm **Shivam Pandey**, a tech explorer dedicated to advancing *AI's explainability and its ability to generalize across tasks with minimal data*.

## Research Orientation: *[WIP]*
**Scaling computes, not comprehension.**

> Even massive compute and oceans of data only deliver brute-force winsâ€”they scale performance, not true insight. These systems remain data inefficient and fail to generalize, missing the mark on real intelligence.

Currently I'm working on **Quantifying the Intelligence-Compute Decoupling in Modern AI Systems**.
